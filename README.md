# VCore3.0 400mm OpenFront

This is my take at the VCore-3 3D printer from RatRig.

It contains several mods already, the basis is the 400mm VCore-3 from RatRig [https://www.ratrig.com/3d-printing-cnc/3d-printer-kits/all-3d-printer-kits/v-core3configurable.html](https://www.ratrig.com/3d-printing-cnc/3d-printer-kits/all-3d-printer-kits/v-core3configurable.html). The mods I decided to build are: 

* OpenFront Mod: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5140728](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5140728)
